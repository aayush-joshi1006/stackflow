## About the Project

Stackflow is a clean, beginner-friendly project template / application meant to demonstrate structured frontend (and optional backend) code organization, developer-friendly scripts, and a deployable configuration. It is designed to be easy to clone, run, and extend â€” ideal for resumes, interviews, demoing components, or as a starting point for production apps.

> If this repo contains a specific app (e.g., Q&A platform, blog, dashboard), replace this section with a short description of that app, its purpose, and the core features.

- Organized component structure and reusable UI components.
- Responsive layout and accessible UI patterns.
- Example pages: Home, About, Dashboard, Auth (sign in / sign up) â€” adjust based on actual repo.
